# fedex-workaround
Beta version of a tool to automatically format a fedex paper shipment document to fit a 4x6 label profile, and automatically print.

To use:

*Choose a directory to save fedex labels as pdf files to (This requires default settings to use a 4x6 pdf thermal label, and the default printer set to CutePDF Writer) 

*Change the file paths in main.py, fedex-workaround.bat, and fedex-workaround.vbs to match your fedex directory

*Install this script and a third party command line tool PdftoPrinter to this same directory - http://www.columbia.edu/~em36/pdftoprinter.html

*Run this script.


TIP:
Create a shortcut of the vbc file and insert into windows startup folder for silent running
